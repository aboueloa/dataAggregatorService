The Aggregator Service demonstrates two ways of performing concurrent data aggregation in Java, leveraging two distinct approaches to concurrency:

AggregatorService: Utilizes CountDownLatch for synchronization between multiple threads.
AggregatorService2: Leverages Callable tasks with a ThreadPoolExecutor for more flexible and controlled concurrent execution.
Both services aim to aggregate data from multiple sources asynchronously and return the results after all tasks have completed, but they employ different mechanisms to handle parallel execution and synchronization.
